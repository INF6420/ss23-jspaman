    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Josh. I've been playing video games for most of my life, 
        starting when I was young and my brother introduced me to them. If I were to
        pick a favorite genre, it would probably be strategy games, but I find myself 
        playing all sorts! One of my big interests with games is their soundtracks, so 
        you will often find my reviews talking a lot about them! Remember that my reviews
        are based on my experiences and opinions, so don't take anything I say as fact!</p>
