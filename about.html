        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Josh. I've been playing video games for most of my life, 
            starting when I was young and my brother introduced me to them. If I were to
            pick a favorite genre, it would probably be strategy games, but I find myself 
            playing all sorts! One of my big interests with games is their soundtracks, so 
            you will often find my reviews talking a lot about them! Remember that my reviews
            are based on my experiences and opinions, so don't take anything I say as fact!</p>
